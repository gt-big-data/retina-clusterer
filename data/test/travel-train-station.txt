But often the stations the trains depart from are an attraction in their own right, counting among the world's most beautiful pieces of architecture.

The 11 stations include the artistic Hundertwasser Bahnhof in Germany, decorated in the style of artist Friedensreich; futuristic Gare de Liege-Guillemins in Belgium, with its "gigantic arched roof that spans the entire length of the station"; and the soon-to-be-completed World Trade Center Transportation Hub in New York "that will set new standards in station architecture."

The report adds that historical stations are now being eyed for elaborate and unusual renovations.

King's Cross in London and Gare de Strasbourg in France, for instance, are among stations that are now part modern art and part historical landmarks.

Meanwhile, architectural masterpieces like Grand Central Terminal in New York and Chhaatrapati Shivaji Terminus in Mumbai are equally as impressive today as they were when opening in 1913 and 1888, respectively.
