Who Ya Got in a 7-Game Series: Atlanta Hawks or Golden State Warriors?
Statistics, standings and power rankings all agree: In the 2014-15 NBA season, it's the Atlanta Hawks, Golden State Warriors and then everyone else.

Atlanta owns the season's longest winning streak (19 games) and biggest conference lead (eight games). Golden State has the league's highest winning percentage (.830) and best net efficiency rating (plus-13.0 points per 100 possessions).

When these two teams take the floor for Friday's highly anticipated heavyweight prizefight, it's anyone's guess as to how the contest will play out. Strange things can happen in a single game: The Dubs have already been defeated by the bottom-feeding Los Angeles Lakers and Utah Jazz, and the Hawks have suffered losses to the Lakers and Orlando Magic.

A head-to-head tango can go so many different ways. But framing this discussion in the context of a seven-game series strips away some of those unpredictable elements.

If the law of averages wins out, which team is better equipped to survive a series with the other: Atlanta or Golden State?
